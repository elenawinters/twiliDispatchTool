    Howdy! It's Jaedlyn.

    <br><br>First things first, include the ðŸŽ§ emote at the end of any given channel field if a dispatcher is on that frequency, and post that status frequently!

    <br><br>Second thing, DOC are currently legally allowed to carry Government Radios, despite what has been relayed by the city council. If DOC are on duty, treat radio as compromised.
    <br>If you have a radio without a serial number, throw it away and purchase a new one.

    <br><br>DOC are also legally able to wear elements of the PD/EMS Uniform.

    <br><br>Thank you.
