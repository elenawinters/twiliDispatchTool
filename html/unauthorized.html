		<!-- Hey, it's Jaedlyn.
		<br><br>I have worked on this tool for a long time, and have had little gratification in doing so.
        <br>As of Monday, August 5th, 2024, I have retired from dispatching. I have expressed my reasons as to why in a lengthy message directed towards the High Commands
        <br>of the Blaine Country Sheriff's Office and the Los Santos Police Department.
        <br><br>Being as I have worked on this tool, and the police departments not giving us support to continue in this profession, I have decided to retire this tool as well.
        <br><br>For those who wish to remain, you may, and you still have access. If you can't load the page, please, follow the link below, and if you are approved, you will gain access.
        <br><br><a tabindex="-1" href="/login" target="_blank">Dispatch Tool Login</a>
        <br>Please reach out directly for approval.
		
		<br><br>May the future be brighter for this profession.
		<br>Thank you all. I must move on to other things. -->
