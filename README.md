# Dispatch Tool

Welcome to the Standalone Dispatch Tool. I've spent about a year or so improving and building this tool.

## Languages
The backend is written in Typescript. The frontend is html/scss/js.

This project depends on:
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Python (building)

## Libraries
This project requires Express, ExpressWS, and MsgPack

## Where's the license?

The original Dispatch Tool, made by ThePhilderbeast, never included a license. As such, I'm not going to either.


## Original Work

https://gitlab.com/p6339/nopixel/dispatch-tools

## Assets folder

Icons in the assets folder came from Google Fonts or their origin is unknown.

## Final remarks

This was changed a bit from the non standalone version. The version that I have put so many hours into had slightly different infrastructure (relying on Discord authentication). I have modified this to work without it, but, honestly, expect it to crash occasionally. I offer no support for your use of this.
