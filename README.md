# Dispatch Tool

Welcome to the Standalone Dispatch Tool. I've spent about a year or so improving and building this tool.

## Languages
The backend is written in Typescript. The frontend is html/scss/js.

This project depends on:
- TypeScript
- Sass
- Python (building)

## Libraries
This project requires Express, ExpressWS, and MsgPack

## Where's the license?

The original Dispatch Tool, made by ThePhilderbeast, never included a license. As such, I'm not going to either.
